# Tic-Tac-Toe Mobile App Automation

## Introduction
This project automates the testing of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe mobile game using **Appium** and **Java**. The automation focuses on simulating gameplay, interacting with in-game ads, and validating user interface functionality. By automating the testing process, the project helps identify bugs early and ensures the app performs as expected across multiple rounds of play.

## Project Type
Backend (Test Automation)

## Deployed App
- **App under Test**: Tic-Tac-Toe APK (Installed Locally)
- **Automation Tool**: Appium

## Video Walkthrough of the Project
- **Project Demo**: [Watch here](https://youtu.be/your-video-link)
- A quick walkthrough showing how the Tic-Tac-Toe app is tested using automated scripts.

## Video Walkthrough of the Codebase
- **Codebase Overview**: [Watch here](https://youtu.be/your-codebase-walkthrough-link)
- A short tour of the project's codebase, explaining the structure and flow of the automation scripts.

## Features
- **Automated Gameplay**: Plays multiple rounds of Tic-Tac-Toe, simulating user interactions with the app.
- **Ad Handling**: Detects and closes in-game ads to ensure uninterrupted testing.
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Can be run on Android emulators or real devices.
- **Reusable Test Scripts**: Modular design using Page Object Model (POM) for easy maintenance.

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
- **Page Object Model (POM)** is used for modularity and maintainability.
- **Ad Detection**: Since ads appear randomly, a flexible handler was created to interact with ads when they pop up.
- **Game State**: Assumed the game resets correctly after each round, allowing for continuous testing without manual intervention.
  
## Installation & Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK 8+)**
- **Appium Server**
- **Android Studio** (for Emulator) or a real Android device
- **Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA**

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/tic-tac-toe-automation.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-automation
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Start the Appium server:
   ```bash
   appium
   ```

4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

5. Optionally, install the APK on your emulator or device:
   ```bash
   adb install path-to-apk/TicTacToe.apk
   ```

## Usage

The test suite will:
1. Launch the Tic-Tac-Toe app.
2. Automate multiple rounds of gameplay.
3. Handle in-game ads when they appear.
4. Reset and continue for the next iteration.

Example snippet for automated gameplay:
```java
@Test
public void Gameplay() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        // Simulate game actions
        driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.twismart.games.tictactoe:id/player1")).click();
        driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.twismart.games.tictactoe:id/facil")).click();
        // More game interactions...
        driver.findElement(MobileBy.id("com.twismart.games.tictactoe:id/newgame")).click();
    }
}
```

### Screenshots
Include screenshots of the app interface (if needed) and test execution.

## Credentials
There are no login credentials required for this project as it automates the testing of a publicly available game app.

## APIs Used
No external APIs are used. This project focuses on **UI Automation** using Appium for a local mobile app.

## Technology Stack
- **Java**: Core programming language used for the automation scripts.
- **Appium**: Used for automating the testing of mobile applications.
- **Maven**: Project build tool and dependency management.
- **Android Studio/Emulator**: For running the Tic-Tac-Toe app.
  
## Project API Endpoints
No APIs were created for this project since it's focused on test automation.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **In-App Ad Handling**:
   - **Challenge**: Randomly appearing ads interrupt the gameplay.
   - **Solution**: Implemented a dynamic handler that detects and interacts with ads, closing them when they appear.

2. **UI Elements Not Loading on Time**:
   - **Challenge**: Sometimes UI elements were delayed.
   - **Solution**: Implemented explicit wait strategies to ensure elements are interactable before proceeding.
